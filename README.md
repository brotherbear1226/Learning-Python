The code in this repo is a place where I store some of the projects I was working on in college. Some of them may not work 100% exact for your needs but it should be used more so as a template to help if any one is stuck on code. 
This is just a space where I can learn to further my coding skills and to work on new projects. 

I am a beginner as we all once were, the key the getting better is just to code! Read it, write it, eat it! 
Happy coding
